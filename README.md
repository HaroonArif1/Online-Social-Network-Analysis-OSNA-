## Online Social Network Analysis (OSNA)

### Description
This project focuses on performing an in-depth analysis of a Twitter user's social network by collecting and processing raw data using the `Twitter API`. Through advanced social network analysis techniques, the project uncovers key network properties, identifies influencers, and provides actionable insights into social connectivity.

### Objective
To analyze and visualize the structure, behavior, and influence within a social network using quantitative metrics and visualization tools.

### Features
- **Data Collection**: 
  - Integrated the `Twitter API` to gather raw social network data for over 300 users.
- **Visualization**: 
  - Developed interactive and detailed social network graphs using Python's `Networkx` library.
- **Analysis**: 
  - Evaluated critical network metrics, including:
    - `Degree Distribution`
    - `Clustering Coefficient`
    - `Closeness and Betweenness Centrality`
    - `Network Density`
    - `Metric Closure`
- **Insights**: 
  - Identified key influencers and community clusters to better understand social connectivity and behavior.

### Tools & Technologies
- `Python`
- `Twitter API`
- `Networkx`

## Data Files
This project uses two text files, `twitter_user_data1.txt` and `twitter_user_data2.txt`, which contain Twitter user data collected through the Twitter API. These files are used for analyzing and visualizing the social network.

### File Descriptions:
- **`twitter_user_data1.txt`**: Contains a subset of Twitter user data, including user IDs, names, and usernames for initial analysis.
- **`twitter_user_data2.txt`**: Contains additional Twitter user data for extended analysis and comparison.
